		<p class="p">The NEMSIS data specification content has been developed over the past 20 years by a variety of 
		partners. Professional organizations contributing to the content include American Ambulance Association (AAA), 
		American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), American College of Surgeons: Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT),
		American Heart Association (AHA), Emergency Medical Services Outcomes Project (EMSOP), International 
		Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), National Academy 
		of Emergency Medical Dispatch (NAEMD), National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT), 
		National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP), National Association of State EMS Officers (NASEMSO), 
		National EMS Management Association ( NEMSMA, formerly NAEMSQP), and the National Emergency Number 
		Association (NENA). Supporting federal partners include National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
		(NHTSA), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Emergency Medical Services for Children 
		Program (EMSC), EMSC National Resource Center (NRC), EMSC National EMSC Data Analysis Resource Center 
		(NEDARC), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Federal Emergency Management Administration 
		(FEMA), and HRSA's Office of Rural Health Policy (ORHP). NEMSIS has been adopted in 46 states and 
		territories and implemented by scores of software providers.</p>

		 
		<p class="p"> The NEMSIS data set supports many uses, including the transfer of patient care reports from
			EMS crews to emergency departments, the prepopulation of hospital electronic health
			records, identification of trauma registry candidates, and preparation of data for
			submission to NEMSIS for research. The current specification is designed for the first
			of these use cases.</p>

		<p class="p"> Implementers may generate the same patient care reports that they generate today and
			attach them under the CDA header in “level one” documents, or they may populate the structured 
			sections as specified herein. </p>

<p class="p">A separate effort to develop an implementation guide is the Emergency Transfer of Care specified 
by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) as the level two template 1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.5.3.1.1.19.1. 
These templates may be harmonized in the future; at this point, they are distinct.</p>
