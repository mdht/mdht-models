		<title>Null Value Mapping</title>
		<body>
			<p>NEMSIS contains null values not listed in HL7. "Not applicable" maps directly to "Not applicable", but
			"Not recorded" and "Not reported" must be represented as the general concept "No information".
			These NEMSIS values may also be copied into Observation.text.</p>
			
			<p>NEMSIS also contains "pertinent negatives", most of which are addressed with negation and special
			cases in this document. Some of the negative action values, however, are actually null values, and are
			recorded as "NI", no information. A mapping of negative action values is provided in Appendix B.</p>
