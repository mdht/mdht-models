		<p>This implementation guide provides constraints to allow implementers to develop CDA-compliant
			documents that support a common set of information in the emergency medical services
			(EMS) domain. </p>
		<p>This release covers the provision of information from an EMS crew to a receiving hospital
			or emergency department. A future release will cover the entire EMS dataset; this document will be
			a template within that specification.</p>
