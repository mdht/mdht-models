					<p class="p">The document focuses on
			 the use case describing the communication of that portion of the death record
			  collected by clinicians to appropriate local, state, and territorial vital
			   statistics agencies using the HL7 Clinical Document Architecture. The goal
			    of the implementation guide is to provide safe, reliable delivery of 
			    relevant clinical information to vital records. The use case supported by
			    this implementation guide does not cover the data that is reported by 
			    funeral directors.</p>

			    
			    <p class="p">This use case is not intended to cover reporting to national public
			     health agencies (NCHS).</p>

			     
			     <p class="p">The following assumption is a precondition for the use of this 
                 implementation guide: The data requirements for clinician supplied death
                  information for items to be completed by the medical certifier according
                   to the Edit Specifications for the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death. 
                   The jurisdiction may have additional data requirements and edit
                    specifications that will be addressed at the jurisdictional level.</p>

	
			<p class="p">This project supports reusability and ease of data collection
			through a standard data representation harmonized with work developed
			through Health Information Technology Expert Panel (HITEP), balloted
			through Health Level Seven (HL7) and/or recognized by the Health
			Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP).</p>
