    The Assessment and Plan Section contains information about the assessment of the patient's condition and&#xD;
    expectations for care including proposals, goals, and order requests for monitoring, tracking, or improving the&#xD;
    condition of the patient. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An assessment and plan section varies from the plan of care section defined later in that it includes a&#xD;
    physician assessment of the patient condition. &#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>NOTE &lt;/b>:&#xD;
    The assessments described in this section are physician assessments of the patient's current condition, and do not&#xD;
    include assessments of functional status, or other assessments typically used in nursing. In Implementation Guides&#xD;
    currently selected, when both the assessment and plan are documented, they are included together in a single section&#xD;
    documenting both. When the physician assessment is not present, only the plan of care section appears. There are no&#xD;
    cases where a physician assessment is provided without a plan.   &#xD;
