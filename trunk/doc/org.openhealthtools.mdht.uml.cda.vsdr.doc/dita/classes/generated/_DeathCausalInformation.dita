<p><lines><i>The template contains information provided by the clinician to indicate the cause or causes behind the person's death.  The information includes the chain of events that directly caused the death, and includes other significant conditions contributing to death.  For clinician reporting, there may be up to four causal elements provided, along with a single statement of the other significant conditions.

The clinical document is also used by the National Center for Health Statistics to provide a set of codes for the cause of death.  The ICD classification system is used for cause of death coding, and the coding is done using the SuperMICAR algorithm to transform the information provided by the clinician into a set of coded values.  When coded cause of death information is provided, the clinican supplied text is included using the original text property of the CD data type.</i></lines></p>
