	<h1 class="title topictitle1">Implementation Guide Scope</h1>

	<div class="body">
		<p class="p"> The scope of this Implementation Guide, which relies on the Clinical Document Architecture, 
		is intended to allow communication of the relevant information captured for a study subject during
		the conduct of the study.  Although this specification can be used for company-to-company 
		communication, the initial intent is for communication from applicant to regulatory authority. 
		</p>

		
		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Vocabulary considerations</strong></p>

		<p class="p">HL7's Clinical Document Architecture takes a very general approach to vocabulary issues.  It 
		encourages the development of templates to express structures for which definite conformance rules
		are defined, and which may repeat both across documents and within a single document. The CDA also
		identifies coded attributes - those attributes whose value is expected to be drawn from a defined
		vocabulary or code set.  In addition, the CDA schema includes a special feature - the observation
		 (a class drawn from the HL7 information model)- which can be used to convey virtually any type of 
		 information.  Within the observation, the content of <em class="ph i">observation code</em> tells you what kind of 
		 information is included, and the content of <em class="ph i">observation value</em> gives you the information itself.
		 CDA does not, and cannot, define the types of observation which are relevant.</p>

		  
		 <p class="p">A key role of the implementation guide is to give an account of: the templates used for a particular
		 set of requirements, the list of observation types that are needed, and the collection of value 
		 sets(code tables) needed to properly define allowable values for the coded attributes used for
		 conveying study subject data.</p>

		 
			<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Identifier considerations</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><em class="ph i">Text needs to be added to address our approach to managing identifiers.  I have not added
		material here, because I am not clear on how HL7's call for a UUID is going to be handled.  Note,
		if the IG is not balloted, that gives us more freedom to use the null flavor approach and leave
		the II root empty.</em></p>
