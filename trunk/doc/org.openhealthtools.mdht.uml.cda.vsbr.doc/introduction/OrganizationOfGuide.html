		<div class="body">
			<p class="p">Templates are organized by document (see Document Templates), by
				section (see Section Templates), and by clinical statements (see
				Clinical Statement Templates). Within a section, templates are
				arranged hierarchically, where a more specific template is nested
				under the more generic template that it conforms to. See Templates
				by Containment for a listing of the higher level templates by
				containment; the appendix Templates Used in This Guide includes a
				table of all of the templates Organized Hierarchically.</p>

		<h2 class="title topictitle2">Vocabulary and Value Sets</h2>

		<div class="body">
			<p class="p">The Implementation Guide provides definition for the vocabulary items that are 
			needed as content for those elements using coded data types.  The use of coded types, and 
			the precise expression of the valid content of code sets is essential to enable efficient 
			processing of subject data report content, and to allow the proper use of the contained data. Within this
			guide, the vocabulary section documents the various act code values used to define structural elements - to
			identify particular acts or observations.  It also defines the several value sets needed to constrain the 
			semantic content of coded items.  In principle, all the vocabulary needed to support subject data reporting
			would draw on a common set of concepts.  This has been done wherever possible, and the Public Health Information
			Network (PHIN) Vocabulary Access and Distribution System (VADS) is used as the repository and source for
			 the commonly agreed upon vocabulary items.</p>

			 
			 <p class="p">In a nunber of cases, the NCVS edit specifications for data collection allow the entry of "UNKNOWN" to represent
			 the case in which desired information is not available.  This concept is captured, within this implementation guide,
			 through use of the nullFlavor - UNK".  The reader should note that the value sets for this implementation guide
			 include concepts from the HL7 NullFlavor code system as well as from other code systems, e.g., SNOMED CT.  If an
			 instance needs to contain an value such as UNK - from the NullFlavor code systems, that value is passed within the 
			 nullFlavor attribute of the coded element as opposed to within the code attribute.</p>

			 
			 <p class="p">Throughout this Implementation Guide, the bindings between coded attributes and the cited value sets are dynamic.  It is 
			 expected that implementations will use the most recent version of the value sets as published within PHIN VADS. </p>
