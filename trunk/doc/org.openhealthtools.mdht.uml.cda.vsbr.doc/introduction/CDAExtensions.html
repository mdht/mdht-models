	<div class="body">
		<p class="p">Where there is a need to communicate information for which there is no suitable
		 representation in CDA R2, extensions to CDA R2 have been developed. 
		 
		 This section serves to summarize the
		  extensions to provide implementation guidance. 
		 
		 
		 Elements containing
		 extensions are documented within the template where they are used. 
		 
		 Note, it has not been necessary to define
		  extensions beyond those already created by the HL7 Structured Documents Work Group.
		 
		  In order to take advantage of these features, it is helpful to use the schemas, SDTC.xsd,
		   CDA_SDTC.xsd, and POCD_MT000040_SDTC, that have been distributed as part
        of the Consolidated CDA distribution.  It will also be necessary to declare the "sdtc" 
        namespace that is used for this extension.
		 </p>

		  
		  <p class="p">Extensions used within this implmentation guide include:</p>

		  <ul class="ul">
		  <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">sdtc:id</strong> CDA R2 does not include an identifier for the subject of a section.  The
		  identifier has been added to allow the medicl record number assigned to a newborn to be 
		  recorded.</li>

		  </ul>
