	<div class="body">
		<p class="p">This specification covers the provision of live birth and fetal death reporting data to the applicable
		 jurisdictional Vital Records Office.  The guide focuses on the use case describing the form and content of
		  that portion of the record collected by electronic health record systems for transmission to state/jurisdictional vital
		   record offices. The goal of the use
		    case is to provide safe, reliable delivery of relevant clinical information to vital records. The use
		    case does not cover the data that is reported by the mother, or in the case of fetal death, by the funeral
		     director. The use case covers events that are recorded by a birthing facility in an EHR.  Planned or 
		     unplanned home births are generally not recorded by the hospital unless the mother is taken there 
		     immediately after birth for emergency medical care, and even in these cases, the home birth is usually 
		     filed by the home birth attendant. This use case is not intended to cover reporting to national public health
agencies such as NCHS." 
         </p>

         
       
      <p class="p">The following use case provides a common scenario for the recording of birth and fetal death events in
       a birthing hospital.  For the birth record, prenatal care and pregnancy history information, such
        as the mother’s last menstrual period (LMP), are obtained from the mother’s prenatal records which are
         sent to the hospital by the prenatal care provider prior to the mother’s estimated delivery date. 
         Information about the labor and delivery and the infant (e.g., a spontaneous vaginal delivery of a 
         girl weighing 3,242 grams) is documented by the nurse in the hospital’s labor and delivery (L&amp;D) log. 
         Information about the labor and delivery and the newborn to be collected for the birth record is 
         also documented by the nurse in the Facility Worksheet for the Child’s Birth Certificate. The 
         pediatrician documents the physical assessment in the newborn’s medical record and the nurse then 
         completes the newborn information sections of the Facility Worksheet.</p>
  
         
         <p class="p">The birth information specialist (BIS), the hospital staff person responsible for gathering and 
         entering information for the birth certificate, checks the hospital’s information system for a list 
         of all new births. The staff person prints a copy of the list and takes it to the L&amp;D unit where they pick up the 
         Facility Worksheet completed by the nurse. The BIS then goes to the mother’s room and presents her 
         with a packet of information and several forms to complete. One of the forms, called the Mother’s 
         Worksheet for the Child’s Birth Certificate, collects important demographic information on the 
         mother and father. The BIS helps the mother complete the Mother’s Worksheet. The BIS reviews the 
         Facility Worksheet for completeness. If a section has not been completed, the L&amp;D log, 
         mother’s prenatal care and other medical records are reviewed for the required information.  If necessary, the 
       the prenatal care provider is called in order to supply more information. </p>

         
         <p class="p">The BIS may enter the information from the Mother’s and Facility worksheets into the State’s 
         web-based Electronic Birth Registration System (EBRS). At the time of data entry, the EBRS performs 
         field edits and cross-field edits that are pre-programmed into the system. Once the record “passes” 
         all validations, the BIS submits the record to the state for registration. The birth record is then 
         automatically transmitted over a secure Internet connection to the State Office of Vital Records.</p>

         
         <p class="p">The vital records registrar reviews a list of newly transmitted birth records received from birthing
          facilities around his state. If there are records that have not passed all edits, the registrar contacts the hospital
           and requests that they correct and retransmit the birth record. The hospital corrects the birth record
            and retransmits. Once the birth record has passed all edits, the vital records registrar registers the
             baby’s birth and the mother is provided with a certified copy of the birth certificate on request.</p>

             
             <p class="p">The process of collecting information at the hospital for the fetal death report is similar to that
              for birth. The labor and delivery nurse enters information in the medical records and completes the
               Facility Worksheet. The BIS is responsible for gathering and entering information into the Electronic
                Fetal Death Registration System (EFDRS) for the fetal death report. The nurse first checks the hospital’s
                 information system and learns about the mother’s loss.  The BIS obtains the completed Facility Worksheet
                  from the nurse and helps the mother complete the Patient’s Worksheet. The BIS may also contact the
                   prenatal care provider to obtain the Mother’s prenatal care information and the obstetrician to
                    enter the cause of death in the system. </p>

                    
                    <p class="p">The hospital of birth will serve as the source for information drawn from the mother’s and infant’s electronic 
                    medical record.  This data may be directly entered by the responsible person.  Data items may also be 
                    extracted from the electronic record system used to support patient medical records.  In such cases,
                     we expect the IHE (Interconnecting the Health Enterprise) specifications for Labor and Delivery
                      Profiles to be useful.</p>
