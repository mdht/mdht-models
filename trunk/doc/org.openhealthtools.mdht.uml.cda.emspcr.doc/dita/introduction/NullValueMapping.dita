		<title>Null Value Mapping</title>
		<body>
			<p>NEMSIS contains null values not listed in HL7. â€œNot applicableâ€� maps directly to â€œNot applicable,â€� but
			â€œNot recordedâ€� and â€œNot reportedâ€� must be represented as the general concept â€œNo information.â€�
			These values may also be copied into Observation.text.</p>
			
			<p>NEMSIS also contains â€œnegative action values,â€� most of which are addressed with negation and special
			cases in this document. Some of the negative action values, however, are actually null values, and are
			recorded as â€œNI,â€� no information. A mapping of negative action values is provided in Appendix B.</p>
