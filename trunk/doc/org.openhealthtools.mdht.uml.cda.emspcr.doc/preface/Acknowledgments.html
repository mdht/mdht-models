		<p class="p">This implementation guide was developed with the support and sponsorship of the National EMS 
Information System (NEMSIS), directed by Clay Mann. Additional clinical guidance was provided by Dr. 
Greg Mears. NEMSIS is supported by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Centers 
for Disease Control, and the Health Resources and Services Administration, as well as dozens of other 
government agencies, universities, and professional organizations.

<p class="p"> 
Shakir Consulting was instrumental in the creation of the domain analysis model and constrained model 
that inform this specification. 
</p>


<p class="p"> 
The HL7 Patient Care, Emergency Care, and Clinical Interoperability Council working groups sponsored 
the project, but we also leaned heavily on the work done by HL7’s Structured Documents committee, 
as well as exemplary guides produced by other teams, most notably the Healthcare Associated Infections 
team. Special thanks go to Russ Hamm, Jerry Sable, Rob Hausam, Keith Boone, Dan Leonard, and Dan 
Vreeman.
</p>


<p class="p"> 
The work could not have been completed without the indefatigable assistance of Jaci Phillips and the 
support of the Regenstrief institute.
