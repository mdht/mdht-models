<p>Used to contain comments associated with any of the data within the document.</p>
<p>This entry allows for a comment to be supplied with each entry. For CDA this structure is usually included in the target act using the &lt;entryRelationship> element defined in the CDA Schema, but can also be used in the &lt;component> element when the comment appears within an &lt;organizer>.</p>

<p>Any condition or allergy may be the subject of a comment.</p>
<p>This module contains a comment to be supplied for any other entry Content Modules.</p>
