<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">[ClinicalDocument: templateId <tt class="ph tt">2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.21.1.1</tt>]</p>


<div class="section">
<p class="p">This section describes constraints that apply to CDA

documents defined for general exchange in the US realm. The template defined here should be reused

wherever these general header constraints are applied.</p>


<p class="p">To support communication between the receiver of the document and the patient or any

other person or organization mentioned within it, the elements representing them will

be named.</p>


<p class="p">When name, address, or telecom information is unknown and where these elements are

required to be present, as with CDA conformance if the information is unknown, these

elements will be represented using an appropriate value for the nullFlavor attribute on

the element.</p>


<p class="p">Events occurring at a single point in time that are represented in the Clinical Document

header will in general be precise to the day. These point-in-time events are the time of

creation of the document; the starting time of a participation by an author, data

enterer, authenticator, or legal authenticator; or the starting and ending time of an

encounter.</p>


<p class="p">Within the specification, all telephone numbers are to be encoded using a grammar

which is a restriction on the TEL data type and RFC 2806. It simplifies interchange between applications as

it removes optional URL components found in RFC 2806 that applications typically do

not know how to process, such as ISDN sub-address, phone context, or other dialing

parameters.</p>


<p class="p">Organizations that wish to use OIDs should properly register their OID root and ensure

uniqueness of the OID roots used in identifiers. A large number of mechanisms exist

for obtaining OID roots for free or for a reasonable fee. HL7 maintains an OID registry

page from which organizations may request an OID root under the HL7 OID root. This

page can be accessed at: http://www.hl7.org/oid.</p>


<p class="p">Another useful resource lists the many ways to obtain a registered OID Root for free or

a small fee anywhere in the world and is located at:</p>


<p class="p">http://www.dclunie.com/medical-image-faq/html/part8.html#UIDRegistration.</p>


<p class="p">The manner in which the OID root is obtained is not constrained by this DSTU.</p>

<p class="p">There are constraints on templateId which are not included.  The templateId SHALL NOT 
use <tt class="ph tt">templateId.extension</tt>.  The templateId SHALL be a syntactically correct OID,
REGEX  (egrep syntax) "[0-2].[0-9](\.[0-9]+)+", the templateId SHALL include (several OIDS which
the new template may or may not conform) 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.3, 
1.3.6.1.4.1.19376.1.5.3.1.1.1,  and (presumably) 2.16.840.1.113883.10.20.1.</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The dataEnterer element represents the person who transferred the information from
other sources into the clinical document, where the other sources wrote the content of
the note. The guiding rule of thumb is that an author provides the content found
within the header or body of the document, subject to their own interpretation. The
dataEnterer adds information to the electronic system. A person can participate as
both author and dataEnterer.</p>

<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The legalAuthenticator element identifies the legal authenticator of the document and
must be present if the document has been legally authenticated. Based on local
practice, clinical documents may be released before legal authentication. This implies
that a clinical document that does not contain this element has not been legally
authenticated.</p>

<p class="p">The act of legal authentication requires a certain privilege be granted to the legal
authenticator depending upon local policy. All clinical documents have the potential for
legal authentication, given the appropriate credentials.</p>

<p class="p">Local policies may choose to delegate the function of legal authentication to a device or
system that generates the clinical document. In these cases, the legal authenticator is
a person accepting responsibility for the document, not the generating device or system.</p>

</ol>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p">The authenticator identifies the participant who attested to the accuracy of the
information in the document.</p>

<p class="p">Automated systems, such as a PHR, that allow a clinical document to be generated need to give
special consideration to authentication permissions because the information contained in the
document may come from sources or contain information that the author cannot validate.</p>

<li class="li"><strong class="ph b">SHALL</strong> satisfy: All patient, guardianPerson, assignedPerson, maintainingPerson, relatedPerson, intendedRecipient/informationRecipient, associatedPerson, and relatedSubject/subject elements have a name. (CONF-CONSOL-1)<ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><tt class="ph tt">Person.name</tt>  SHALL</strong>  follow the convention of having each name part (e.g. given name, family name)  
represented as a discrete <strong class="ph b"><tt class="ph tt">ENXP</tt></strong>.  These <strong class="ph b">SHALL</strong> be in the same order which the name normally would be written.  
The name SHALL convey at least one <tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b">EntityName.use</strong> (SET&lt;CS&gt;)</tt> drawn from <tt class="ph tt">EntityNamePartQualifier</tt>
Concept Domain / Value Set (2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.15888)  based on <tt class="ph tt"><em class="ph i">EntityNamePartQualifier</em></tt> HL7 code system 
(2.16.840.1.113883.5.43).  
 In cases where the name has not been the full and legal name for the individual, (for example the patient changed their name 
when married, a "John Doe" name for a patient was retired after determining their actual identity) the 
<tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b">EntityName.validTime</strong>( IVL&lt;TS&gt;)</tt> <strong class="ph b">SHOULD</strong> be used.  
This is particularly useful in matching records after such name changes, and in cases such as emergency care  and referalls using 
a health record summary such as the Continuity of Care Document (CCD).</p>

<p class="p">The other use case often encountered regards healthcare professionals, particularly physicians.   Because of the importance of 
correctly indentifying an individual and linking them to their credendials (history of specialty and other certificiations),  women (and less 
often, men) may change their names meaning the legal name now reflects taking on the family name of a spouse.  Often a physician will 
keep their previous name for professional matters.</p>

<p class="p">The various parts of the name are captured and represented as <tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b">EntityNamePart (ENXP)</strong></tt> .  The various parts of 
the name are represented with the name of the part, and <strong class="ph b">MAY</strong> include the part type as an attribute, although it is redundant. 
Individual name parts <strong class="ph b">MAY</strong>  use <tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b">EntityNamePart.qualifier</strong> SET&lt;CS&gt;</tt> drawn from Concept Domain / 
Value Set <tt class="ph tt">EntityNamePartQualifier (2.16.840.1.113883.1.11.15888)</tt> based upon the HL7 Code System 
<tt class="ph tt"><em class="ph i">EntityNamePartQualifier</em> (2.16.840.1.113883.5.43)</tt> to clairify complex circumstance, such as  use of a spouses name.
In particular noting that a name part was given at the time of adoption (code <tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">AD</em></strong></tt>), birth (code <tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">BR</em></strong></tt>),  
and marrried name from a spouse (code <tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b"><em class="ph i">SP</em></strong></tt>) can be particularly relevant.</p>

<p class="p">Finally, the name of the person <strong class="ph b">MAY</strong> have the name as it should appear with proper spacing as the <tt class="ph tt"><strong class="ph b">PersonName.formatted</strong> ST</tt></p>
