<div class="section">
<p class="p">This section describes constraints that apply to the H and P Note and to other types of CDA
documents defined for general exchange. The template defined here should be reused
wherever these general header constraints are applied.</p>

<p class="p">To support communication between the receiver of the document and the patient or any
other person or organization mentioned within it, the elements representing them will
be named.</p>

<p class="p">When name, address, or telecom information is unknown and where these elements are
required to be present, as with CDA conformance if the information is unknown, these
elements will be represented using an appropriate value for the nullFlavor attribute on
the element.</p>

<p class="p">Events occurring at a single point in time that are represented in the Clinical Document
header will in general be precise to the day. These point-in-time events are the time of
creation of the document; the starting time of a participation by an author, data
enterer, authenticator, or legal authenticator; or the starting and ending time of an
encounter.</p>

<p class="p">Within the specification, all telephone numbers are to be encoded using a grammar
which is a restriction on the TEL data type and RFC 2806. It simplifies interchange between applications as
it removes optional URL components found in RFC 2806 that applications typically do
not know how to process, such as ISDN sub-address, phone context, or other dialing
parameters.</p>

<p class="p">Organizations that wish to use OIDs should properly register their OID root and ensure
uniqueness of the OID roots used in identifiers. A large number of mechanisms exist
for obtaining OID roots for free or for a reasonable fee. HL7 maintains an OID registry
page from which organizations may request an OID root under the HL7 OID root. This
page can be accessed at: http://www.hl7.org/oid.</p>

<p class="p">Another useful resource lists the many ways to obtain a registered OID Root for free or
a small fee anywhere in the world and is located at:</p>

<p class="p">http://www.dclunie.com/medical-image-faq/html/part8.html#UIDRegistration.</p>

<p class="p">The manner in which the OID root is obtained is not constrained by this DSTU.</p>
