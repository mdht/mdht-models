	<div class="body"><p class="p">This implementation guide was developed with the support and
				sponsorship of the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS), directed by Clay Mann.
				Additional clinical guidance was provided by Dr. Greg Mears. NEMSIS is supported by
				the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Centers for Disease
				Control, and the Health Resources and Services Administration, as well as dozens of
				other government agencies, universities, and professional organizations. The
				Clinical Interoperability Council working groups sponsored this iteration of the
				project; Patient Care, Emergency Care, and Structured Documents assisted with
				previous iterations. Sean Muir assisted with making the rich functionality of the
				Model-Driven Health Tools available. Shakir Consulting was instrumental in the
				creation of the domain analysis model and constrained model that inform this
				specification. The initial LOINC pubication of the terminology work was handled by
				Jaci Phillips, revisions and updates by Jami Deckard, for which we thank the
				Regenstrief institute. </p><p class="p">This document contains information from the
