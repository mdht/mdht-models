  <title>Overview of plug-ins</title>

    specialized document types, integrating processing overrides, or defining new output

    <section>
      <p>A plug-in consists of a directory, typically stored within the
        <filepath>plugins/</filepath> directory inside of the DITA-OT. Every plug-in is controlled
        by a file named <filepath>plugin.xml</filepath>, which is located in the root directory of
        the plug-in.</p>
