  <title>Extension points</title>
  <shortdesc>The DITA Open Toolkit provides a series of extension points that can be used to integrate changes into the
    core code. Extension points are defined in the <filepath>plugin.xml</filepath> file for each plug-in. The DITA-OT
    integration process makes each extension visible to the rest of the toolkit.</shortdesc>
