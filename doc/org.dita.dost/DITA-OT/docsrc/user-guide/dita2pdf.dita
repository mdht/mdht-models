  <title>DITA to PDF (PDF2)</title>
  <shortdesc>The <option>pdf</option> (or <option>pdf2</option>) transformation generates PDF output.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>This transformation was originally created as a plug-in and maintained outside of the main toolkit code. It was
      created as a more robust alternative to the demo PDF transformation in the original toolkit, and thus was known as
      PDF2. The plug-in was bundled into the default toolkit distribution with release 1.4.3.</p>
    <p>To run the PDF transformation, set the <parmname>transtype</parmname> parameter to <option>pdf</option>, or
      pass the <option>-format pdf</option> option to the <cmdname>dita</cmdname> command line.</p>
